Prompt Strategy Summary
The prompt strategy was carefully designed to support content creation, 
system planning, and user experience enhancement. Structured prompts 
were used to generate accurate historical and cultural descriptions for 
heritage and devotional locations while ensuring clarity and cultural 
sensitivity. Additional prompts helped in conceptualizing intelligent route 
planning logic by considering factors such as distance, travel sequence, and 
user preferences.
iterative prompt refinement was applied to improve UI text, accessibility 
guidelines, and overall presentation quality. The strategy focused on 
producing concise, reliable, and user-friendly outputs that align with the 
project’s goal of delivering an engaging and educational heritage tourism 
experience.
