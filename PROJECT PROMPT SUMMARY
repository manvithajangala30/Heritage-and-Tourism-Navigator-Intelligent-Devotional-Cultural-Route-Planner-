Prompts were designed to generate authentic and informative heritage
content that highlights the historical, architectural, and cultural significance 
of South Indian heritage sites. Structured prompts guided the creation of 
clear narratives, timelines, and key facts while maintaining cultural sensitivity 
and accuracy. Additional prompts were used to conceptualize intelligent 
heritage route planning by considering location proximity, travel efficiency
and thematic relevance. The prompt-driven approach ensured consistent 
storytelling, improved user engagement, and supported the development of a 
culturally enriched and educational heritage tourism platform.
